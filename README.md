## ⚡ What is this?

This repo is my **personal ML playground** — a single place where I drop every small AI/ML project I build. Each one lives in its own folder, has its own docs, and most importantly — **it's deployed so you can actually try it**, not just read about it.

I know this stuff. I've read the papers, burned the 3AM oil, debugged the shape mismatches. But this isn't just a flex — it's a **learning resource**. I document everything so that **beginners can follow along**, understand what's happening under the hood, and use these apps as interactive sandboxes instead of staring at static notebooks.

> **"Build it. Deploy it. Let people play with it. That's the only way it's real."**

---

## 🚀 The Philosophy

```
📦  One folder  =  One project
📖  Every project  =  Its own README + documentation
🌐  Every project  =  Live deployed & accessible to anyone
🎓  Every project  =  Explained for beginners, built by someone who knows it
```

I'm not here to collect stars. I'm here to **build things that work**, learn deeply, and make sure others can learn from them too. If you're new to ML — pick any project below, try the live demo, and then come back and read how it works. That's the loop.

## 🔬 Project #01 — Sentiment Analyser (NLP Dashboard)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

### What it does

An **educational NLP comparison dashboard** that takes any sentence and shows you — step by step — how three completely different pipelines process it and arrive at a sentiment prediction.

**Not just a black box.** You see the actual tokenisation, stopword removal, TF-IDF weights, BERT subword splits, probability distributions, and which specific tokens drove the final prediction.

### The models inside

| Model | Approach | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 🔵 **NLTK** | TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | ~83% |
| 🟢 **spaCy** | Lemmatisation + TF-IDF + LR | ~84% |
| 🔴 **RoBERTa** | Pre-trained Transformer | ~93% |
| 🟣 **Fine-tuned RoBERTa** | Your data + gradient descent | 🔥 Custom |

### Key features

- ⚡ Step-by-step pipeline visualisation (every preprocessing step shown)
- 🎯 Interactive probability gauges per model
- 📊 Feature contribution charts (which words drove the prediction)
- 🏋️ Train your own models inside the dashboard
- 📂 Batch CSV inference with live progress
- 🔄 Fine-tune RoBERTa on your own dataset — right in the browser

## 🛣️ What's Coming Next

This workbench is **actively growing**. Here's the vibe of what's in the queue:

```
🔲  Image Classification Dashboard  (CNN vs ViT, step-by-step feature maps)
🔲  Generative Text Explorer         (GPT-2 internals, beam search visualised)
🔲  Tabular ML Explainer             (XGBoost vs Neural Net, SHAP overlays)
🔲  Recommendation Engine            (Collab filtering explained interactively)
🔲  Reinforcement Learning Sandbox   (Watch an agent learn in real-time)
```

Each one will be **deployed and documented** — same format, same philosophy.

## 🎓 For Beginners

Every project in this repo is designed to be **beginner-accessible**:

1. **Try the live demo first** — no setup, no install, just open the link
2. **Read the project README** — it explains the concepts, not just the code
3. **Run it locally** — each project has a clean `setup & run` section
4. **Read the code** — it's commented and structured to be readable

You don't need to understand transformers to use the Sentiment Analyser. But after playing with it for 20 minutes, you'll understand more about how NLP works than most textbook chapters will tell you.

## 🔧 Running Any Project Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run (each project has specific instructions in its README)
streamlit run app.py        # for Streamlit apps
# or
python app.py               # for Flask/FastAPI apps
# or
npm run dev                 # for Next.js projects
```
